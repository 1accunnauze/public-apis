If you are interested in using CASPOC for your simulation needs, you can download it from the official website[^1^]. You will need to register with your name and email address to get access to the download link. You can choose between a free trial version or a full version with a license fee. The free trial version has some limitations such as a maximum of 10 components per schematic and no C code export. The full version has all the features and benefits of CASPOC such as extended library blocks, advanced electrical machine models, extensive library for green energy, temperature dependent semiconductors, animation of the schematic, interface with data acquisition board and other programs, user compiled C/C++ code via DLL, export C code from the control system models, parameter sweep, bode diagram, project management data, scripts and batch mode.
 
After downloading the CASPOC software, you can install it on your computer by following the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter your license key if you have purchased the full version. You can then start using CASPOC to create your own simulation projects or use the examples provided in the software. You can also access the user manual and tutorials from the help menu or from the website[^1^].

## What is CASPOC and How Does It Work?
 
CASPOC stands for Computer Aided Simulation Program for Power Circuits. It is a software that allows you to create and simulate power electronics and electrical drives systems using a graphical user interface. You can drag and drop components from the library to build your schematic, set the parameters for each component, and run the simulation. You can also add math blocks, control blocks, and C code blocks to implement any function or algorithm you want. You can view the simulation results in real time in auto-scaling windows, such as waveforms, phasors, bode plots, FFTs, etc. You can also animate the schematic to see the current path and the state of each component during simulation.
 
CASPOC uses a multilevel model that includes a circuit level, a component level, and a system level. The circuit level is for modeling switched mode power supplies, such as rectifiers, converters, inverters, etc. The component level is for modeling electrical machines and loads, such as induction machines, DC machines, stepper motors, wind turbines, solar modules, etc. The system level is for modeling control algorithms and systems, such as field-oriented control, direct torque control, sensorless control, maximum power point trackers, etc. CASPOC can handle both linear and nonlinear systems, as well as discrete and continuous time systems. CASPOC can also handle multiple domains, such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, magnetic, etc.
