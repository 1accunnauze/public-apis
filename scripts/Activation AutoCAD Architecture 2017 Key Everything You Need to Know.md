## Step 2: Get a request code
 
A request code is a code that you generate on your computer and use to get an activation code from Autodesk. You need a request code if:
 
- You are offline and have a perpetual license for a standalone 2020 (or earlier) product.
- You have an education license and are offline.

To get a request code, follow these steps:

1. Launch AutoCAD Architecture 2017 on your computer.
2. Click **Activate** on the **Let's Get Started** screen.
3. Select **Request an activation code using an offline method**.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Copy the request code that appears on the screen.

Note: Autodesk no longer supports manual offline authentication for 2021 products and later. If you have a perpetual license for a 2021 product or later and want to use it offline, activate your software by going online one time to register. You can then use the software offline. This change doesn't apply to subscription network licenses or previous versions that you already activated offline. You can continue to use them as before.
 
## Step 3: Get an activation code
 
An activation code is a code that you get from Autodesk and use to activate your software. You need an activation code if you have a request code from step 2.
 
To get an activation code, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Autodesk Product Registration and Activation](https://www.autodesk.com/activation).
2. Select **I have an activation code from Autodesk**.
3. Enter your product information, including your serial number and product key.
4. Paste your request code from step 2.
5. Click **Generate Activation Code**.
6. Copy the activation code that appears on the screen.

## Step 4: Activate your software
 
To activate your software, follow these steps:

1. Return to AutoCAD Architecture 2017 on your computer.
2. Select **I have an activation code from Autodesk**.
3. Paste your activation code from step 3.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Your software is now activated and ready to use.
